# Statistical analysis projects
In this repo I list all of the statistical analysis projects using either Python or R 

Project 1
Data was provided by Virginia education Department 
we wanted to answer this question " Which standardized math test taken by Virginia high school students is the best
predictor of college enrollment? "

This project was a research based , we used regression analysis to find correlation among different variables such as race and math scores. The findings were that math tests scores are a  predictor of college enrollment, we also  found that success in the Algebra II and Geometry SOLs predicted college enrollment. Socioeconomic variables mattered as well; these included race and ethnicity,
being disadvantaged, and county of residence.
