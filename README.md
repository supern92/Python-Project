# Statistical analysis projects
In this repo I list all of the statistical analysis projects using either Python or R 


Project 1
The data set is the  Deadly Quarrels. I wanted to to look at the relationships associated with civil wars. I started off looking at eight different variables. Those variables we looked at are described here: 
prevConflict, looking at if there a previous conflict, 
prevConflictYrs, how long hte conflict lasted if there was one, 
chronicFighting, whether or not there was chronic fighting between the sides, 
difWealth, whether or not there was a difference in wealth between the sides, 
difLanguage, whether or not there were different languages on the opposing sides, 
intermingled, which looks at whether the two sides were intermingled in the same territory, 
sameGov, whether or not the sides shared the same government, and 
sameGovYrs, the number of years since the common government was created.
There were also 4 variables that gave us a bit more contextual information on the civil wars: 
revolution, which describes whether or not it is a civil war, 
months, giving us the length of time the conflict lasted, 
deaths, the number of recorded deaths, and 
logDeaths, the number of recorded deaths on a log scale.
Much of this data is categorical, returning either a 0 for no or a yes for 1. Now, for the descriptive statistics:










Project 2
Data was provided by Virginia education Department 
we wanted to answer this question " Which standardized math test taken by Virginia high school students is the best
predictor of college enrollment? "

This project was a research based , we used regression analysis to find correlation among different variables such as race and math scores. The findings were that math tests scores are a  predictor of college enrollment, we also  found that success in the Algebra II and Geometry SOLs predicted college enrollment. Socioeconomic variables mattered as well; these included race and ethnicity,
being disadvantaged, and county of residence.
